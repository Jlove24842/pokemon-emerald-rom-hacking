# pokemon-emerald-rom-hacking

This is a ROM hacking kit for the Pokemon Emerald ROM (USA 1.0).

I hacked together a little demo game [here](), where you can explore the whole emerald world, dumped from the ROM file.
I also added [this]() demo which just showcases a few features of this tool.

The following things are supported:

Graphics:
   - Overworld sprites
   - Pokemon battle sprites (back, front)
   - Pokemon icons
   - Item sprites
   - Field effects (e.g grass, ashe)
   - Tilesets
   - Tileset animations (e.g water, flowers)
   - Door animations

Texts:
 - The text "POKÃ©MON"
 - Attack names
 - Item names
 - Pokemon names

Map related:
 - Map events (NPCs, Warps)
 - Map connections 
 - Map behavior byte
 - Map background byte
 - Map border tile graphic
 
 Happy hacking!
