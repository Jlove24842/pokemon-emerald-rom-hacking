# pokemon-emerald-rom-hacking

This is a ROM hacking kit for the Pokemon Emerald ROM (USA 1.0).

I hacked together a little demo game [here](https://maierfelix.github.io/pokemon-emerald-rom-hacking/static/game/), where you can explore the whole emerald world, dumped from the ROM file.
I also added [this](https://maierfelix.github.io/pokemon-emerald-rom-hacking/static/demo1/) demo which just showcases a few features of this tool.
